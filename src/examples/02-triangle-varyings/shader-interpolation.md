# Triangle with Varyings Example

This example builds upon the basic triangle by introducing vertex attribute interpolation (varyings) in WebGPU. It demonstrates:

- Using vertex attributes to store per-vertex data
- Passing data from vertex shader to fragment shader using varyings
- Interpolation of vertex attributes across the triangle
- Color interpolation techniques

This example shows how to create more visually interesting effects by passing data between shader stages.
