# Camera Look-At Example

This example implements a camera system using the look-at matrix in WebGPU. It covers:

- Camera system implementation
- View matrix creation
- Look-at matrix calculation
- Camera movement and orientation
- Perspective projection

## Key Concepts

- Camera matrices
- View transformation
- Look-at matrix mathematics
- 3D space navigation
- Camera controls
- Perspective projection setup

This example shows how to implement a basic camera system, allowing for 3D scene navigation and viewing from different angles.
